Two key points

nums[i] means number at the index

nums[i]-1 means find the index of the number which is placed on the nums[i]
nums[nums[i]-1] means find the corresponding number for swap.

4 3 2 1
0 1 2 3

nums[2] = 1 -> it means we must have 1 at the index 1.
nums[2] -1 = 0 -> it means we must move to the 0 index

now lets find what is at the zero index

nums[nums[2]-1] = nums[0] = 4

now swap  these values

1 3 2 4
0 1 2 3
