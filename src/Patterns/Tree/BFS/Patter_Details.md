**This patter is known as Breadth first search BFS**

BFS is based on the level by level traversing of a tree.
     A
   B   C
 D  E  F G

A B C D E F G -> Is the level by level traversing. 

For this we use queue hence the space complexity is O(M) where m is the maximum number of nodes on any level.
