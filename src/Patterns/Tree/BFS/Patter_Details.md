**This patter is known as Breadth first search BFS**

BFS is based on the level by level traversing of a tree.
     A
   B   C
 D  E  F G

A B C D E F G -> Is the level by level traversing. 

Breadth-First Search (BFS) Algorithm: It also starts from the root node and visits all nodes of current depth before moving to the next depth in the tree.


For this we use queue hence the space complexity is O(M) where m is the maximum number of nodes on any level.
